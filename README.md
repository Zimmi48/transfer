#Automatic transfer of theorems in Coq

This repository contains two directories, *plugin* and *library*.

The two contain independent implementations of way of transferring theorems but
*library* is more recent, much more powerful and probably even easier to use so
you should prefer that one.

Each directory contains instructions on how to use.

The ideas behind the two are described in the following paper:

* Zimmermann T. and Herbelin H.
*Automatic and Transparent Transfer of Theorems along Isomorphisms in the Coq Proof Assistant.*
